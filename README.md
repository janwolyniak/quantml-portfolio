# QuantML Portfolio

Welcome to my personal research and project portfolio in Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning.  
This repository includes my work on pricing models, dynamic systems, trading strategies, simulation environments, and supporting utilities.  
It reflects both applied development and ongoing research-oriented exploration.

## About Me

I'm a Machine Learning researcher and Quantitative Finance master's student at the University of Warsaw.  
My core interests include:

- Pricing models and market dynamics
- Machine learning strategies for arbitrage and market making
- Simulation-based research environments using pretrained models and internal feedback
- Explainable AI (XAI), deep learning, and applied optimization

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `research/` | Formal notebooks exploring theoretical and empirical topics in pricing, modeling, and strategy design. |
| `notebooks/` | Informal EDA, prototyping, and exploratory work with visualizations and diagnostics. |
| `trading_strategies/` | Backtestable, modular strategy implementations (market making, arbitrage, etc). |
| `simulation_env/` | Custom market environments for controlled experimentation and modeling. |
| `utils/` | Supporting tools for data handling, feature engineering, and risk evaluation. |
| `web_tools/` | API connectors, data pipelines, scrapers, and auxiliary tools. |
| `personal_webpage/` | Source code for my personal webpage (optional showcase of web development skills). |
